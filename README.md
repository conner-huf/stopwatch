# Stopwatch
 
Mega simple, mega tiny, mega useful. 

This is a stopwatch / count-up timer that shows milliseconds. I saw a youtube video where someone had a timer like this in the corner of their video and I thought it would be useful. Use to your heart's content. 

All you need to use it is the HTML file.
